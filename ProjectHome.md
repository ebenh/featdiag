Over time, Java classes can become large and require refactoring. With the existing tools it can be difficult to determine which members in the classes are tightly coupled in their relationships, and which can be split up.

Feature Diagrams are a graphical representation of these relationships. The concept was conceived by [Micheal Feathers](http://www.michaelfeathers.com/). Implemented as an Eclipse Plug-in, the intention was to have a manipulative graph, and to automate changes to the Java source code through changes to the diagram.

This plug-in was designed and developed by [Nicole Allard](http://nicoleallard.ca) and [Leo Kaliazine](http://individual.utoronto.ca/leok/home/).

Continued development has been done by [Ebenezer Hailemariam](http://derso.org).
