Over time, Java classes can become large and require refactoring. With existing tools it can be difficult to 
determine which class members are tightly coupled and which can be refactored.

Feature Diagrams are a graphical representation of these relationships. The concept was conceived by Micheal Feathers. 
Implemented as a plug-in for Eclipse IDE, the intention was to have a manipulative graph, and to automate changes to Java 
source code by manipulating a diagram.
